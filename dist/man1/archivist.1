.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBArchivist\fP is a time-series daemon which stores metrics in graphite-like paths
and answers query with graphite-like semantics.
.PP
The main options are:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
print help
.TP
\fB-v\fR
print version and exit
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
just test config and exit
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fI<FILE|URI>\fR
select config source instead of default file
.TP
\fB\-E\fR
disable reading variables from the environment
.TP
\fB\-P\fR \fI<prefix>\fP
override the prefix for environment variable
.TP
\fB\-F\fR
disable reading config source (environment only)
.TP
\fB\-R\fR
disable all including of other config
.TP
\fB\-U\fR
disable reading any URI config (even if given with -c)
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
disable URI config including other URI configs
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
allow insecure URI's
.TP
\fB\-I\fR
allow secure URI's to include insecure URI's
.TP
\fB\-K\fR
interactively ask for a TLS key password
.TP
\fB\-T\fR
Validate the certificates of any secure URI's
.TP
\fB\-W\fR
Permit invalid certificates from fetch targets even if we are validating config certificates.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR \fI<suffix>\fR
Set config file suffix filter for include-dir
.TP
\fB\-X\fR
Disable matching config file suffix for include-dir (match all files)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
run in daemon mode (background)
.TP
\fB\-D\fR
run in debug mode
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
run in verbose mode, with more output to stdout
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fI<FILE>\fR
override the configured pidfile
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
be strict about parsing config
.PP
The config file format is in sections, denoted as \fB[Section]\fR and is of a general format of:
.TP
\fBvariable\fR = \fIvalue\fR
.PP
It may use the keyword \fBinclude\fR to read in another file - the current section context is kept.
.PP
The default config file is /etc/ministry/archivist.conf
.SH Behaviour
.PP
\fBArchivist\fP listens on a network port for graphite-like metrics.  It expects to receive a path,
a value and a timestamp on each line.  Metrics are stored in a separate file for each path, with a
simple conversion from '.' to '/' to generate a pathname.  Paths containing '..' are invalid.  Files
are suffixed '.rkv'.  Queries are done over HTTP(S) and are done in-process.  \fBArchivist\fP uses
\fImmap(2)\fP to open and access files, and is expected to use a lot of memory when asked to handle
a lot of paths.  It is also likely to generate a lot of IO if updated at a high rate.
