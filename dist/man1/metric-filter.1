.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBMetric-filter\fP is a network daemon which can filter ministry-style and statsd-style metrics based on
configured rules, forwarding to all configured targets.
.PP
The main options are:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR

.TP
\fB-v\fR

.TP
\fB\-s\fR
be strict about parsing config
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fI<FILE|URI>\fR
select config source instead of default file
.TP
\fB\-P\fR \fI<prefix>\fP
override the prefix for environment variable
.TP
\fB\-E\fR
disable reading variables from the environment
.TP
\fB\-F\fR

\fB\-u\fR
disable URI config including other URI configs
.TP
\fB\-X\fR
disable matching of config file suffix in include-dir

.TP
\fB\-W\fR

.TP
\fB\-x\fR \fI<suffix>\fR
Set config file suffix filter for include-dir
.TP
\fB\-X\fR
Disable matching config file suffix for include-dir (match all files)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
run in daemon mode (background)
.TP
\fB\-D\fR
run in debug mode
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
run in verbose mode, with more output to stdout
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fI<FILE>\fR
override the configured pidfile
.PP
The config file format is in sections, denoted as \fB[Section]\fR and is of a general format of:
.TP
\fBvariable\fR = \fIvalue\fR
.PP
It may use the keyword \fBinclude\fR to read in another file - the current section context is kept.
.PP
The default config file is /etc/ministry/metric-filter.conf
.SH Behaviour
.PP
\fBMetric-filter\fP listens on a network port for graphite metrics, either raw or timestamped.  It
seeks out the first space (or colon) in the metrics and compares the line up to that point against
its filters, to see if the line should be forwarded or dropped.  It uses \fIinotify\fP to watch the
filter files directory and reloads the config upon changes (after a small delay).
