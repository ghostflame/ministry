.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP is a statsd-like statistics daemon that listens on network sockets, UDP or TCP, for
data points, and either adds them or produces metrics suitable for ingestion by graphite, coal or
other time-series databases.  It is written in highly-threaded C.
.PP
The main options are:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
print help
.TP
\fB-v\fR
print version and exit
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
just test config and exit
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fI<FILE>\fR
select config file
.TP
\fB\-D\fR
run in debug mode
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
run in daemon mode (background)
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
run in verbose mode, with more output to stdout
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fI<FILE>\fR
override the configured pidfile
.PP
The config file format is in sections, denoted as \fB[Section]\fR and is of a general format of:
.TP
\fBvariable\fR = \fIvalue\fR
.PP
It may use the keyword \fBinclude\fR to read in another file - the current section context is kept.
.PP
The default config file is /etc/ministry/ministry.conf
.SH Behaviour
.PP
\fBMinistry\fR performs two separate functions - summation of data against paths and generating
simple statistics about input data against paths.  In each case, \fBministry\fR expects graphite-
style dot-delimited, directory-safe strings.  Data submitted to the adder port is simply summed
and then reported onwards.
.PP
The stats port creates an array of values against the path and at submission time this array is
sorted to assess the lowest, highest and median value.  Any configured threshold values are also
calculated.  Then the data is summed to create the arithmetic mean.  The count is also submitted.
.SH Formats
.PP
\fBMinistry\fR accepts data in two formats; a subset of the statsd format and a simpler, new format
specific to \fBministry\fR.  The new format is:
.TP
\fBpath\fR(dot-delimited string) \fIvalue\fR(double)\\n
.PP
\fBMinistry\fR would normally listen on two ports (or sets of ports) to delineate stats traffic
from adder traffic.
.PP
The subset of statsd formats supported is:
.TP
\fBpath\fR(dot-delimited string):\fIvalue\fR(float)|ms\\n
.TP
\fBpath\fR(dot-delimited string):\fIvalue\fR(float)|c\\n
.TP
\fBpath\fR(dot-delimited string):\fI[+/-]value\fR(float)|g\\n
.PP
The first format is used to create stats, the second to aggregate values submitted - they are just
added up - and the third for gauges - keeping track of differences in a value.
.PP
Ministry accepts on either type of port a plain line consisting entirely of:
.TP
\fBkeepalive\fR\\n
.PP
This will prevent connections from being reaped by ministry if no actual metrics are sent over them.
This line is otherwise ignored.
.SH Threading
.PP
\fBMinistry\fR can open up a number of ports, listening on both TCP and UDP for data.  The threading
model runs one thread per TCP port and spawns a new thread per accepted connection, allowing it to
engage multiple cores to handle multiple connections.  However, UDP does not allow that option.
.PP
To permit multiple cores to be used to handle UDP traffic, the config permits multiple UDP ports to
be specified for any format port.  A single thread is created to handle packets received by each
port.
.PP
Data is inserted into the data hashes the by the thread handling the incoming packets - so either a
TCP connection handling thread or a UDP port thread.  Mutexes control the individual hash structures
to mediate data addition collisions.
.PP
At the point of the stats submission timers going off, new threads are created for that single
data submission cycle.  The number of them is configurable.  They walk the data hash 'stealing' the
incoming data points, dropping them on a processing list instead.  Only after all points have been
moved from incoming to processing do they go back and begin stats generation.  This means that the
stats arriving are very cleanly delineated at the submission timer.
