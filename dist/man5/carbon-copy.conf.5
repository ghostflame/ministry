.SH NAME
carbon-copy.conf \- carbon-copy config file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BI /etc/ministry/carbon-copy.conf
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual page describes the configuration file for \fBcarbon-copy(1)\fP.  The file is in
sections, and including other files is permitted, though wildcard expansion is not performed -
included file paths must be complete.  Config is read before \fBcarbon-copy\fP changes to the
configured working directory, so non-absolute paths included are interpreted relative to the
current working directory.
.PP
\fBCarbon-copy\fP has a lot of shared code with \fBministry(1)\fP and some sections are not
described here.  Refer to \fBministry.conf(5)\fP for details.
.SH FORMAT

.SS [Target]
.PP
\fBCarbon-copy\fP has the most complex target configuration of any of the \fBministry\fP family
of programs.  The basic principle is that targets are grouped into lists, or one or more host/
port combinations, which receive identical streams of metrics.  As many lists as are desired
can be configured.  \fBCarbon-copy\fP uses named lists as targets for routing rules.  A given
rule may have a list of target lists and hash across them.  It is for system administrators to
devise a suitable hierarchy or structure for their desired level of resilience.
.PP
The structure and configuration of target lists is otherwise the same as \fBministry.conf(5)\fP.
.SS [Network]
.PP
Networking configuration for \fBcarbon-copy\fP greatly resembles that found in \fBministry\fP,
with the exception that \fBcarbon-copy\fP routers processed metrics, and therefore does not
discriminate between stats, adder or gauge metrics.
.SS [Relay]
.PP
Relay rules are processed in order, and the distribution of metrics to targets is handled
according the type of matching.  Hash types always match, and hash their metrics across a set
of targets.  Regex types have a set of criteria for matching.  Each rule is a block of config
ending in a \fBdone\fP statement.
.PP
Once matching has been determined, the set of targets provided are written to according to the
type.  The special target value \fIblackhole\fP results in metrics being dropped.
.TP
\fBname\fP
The name of the relay rule.  It will be listed as '- unnamed -' in logs if no name is given.
.TP
\fBregex\fP
Regular expression to test against metrics.  Can appear multiple times.  A leading \fI!\fP
indicates a negation of matching, and is stripped before compilation.  Any regex lines will
set the type to regex.
.TP
\fBhash\fP
Hash metric to use.  It is an error to specify this alongside regex type.  The known types
are: \fBcksum\fP, \fBfnv1\fP, \fBfnv1a\fP.  Hash types always match.
.TP
\fBlast\fP
Stop processing if this rule matches.
.TP
\fBcontinue\fP
Continue processing even if this rule matches (this is the default behaviour).
.TP
\fBtarget\fP
Comma-separated list of target names.  The special value (on it's own) \fIblackhole\fP is
interpreted as drop matching metrics.  It is a botch to combine blackhole target and the
\fBcontinue\fP statement.  This/these names will be resolved against \fBTarget\fP config.
