.SH NAME
metric-filter.conf \- metric-filter config file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BI /etc/ministry/metric-filter.conf
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual page describes the configuration file for \fBmetric-filter(1)\fP.  The file is in
sections, and including other files is permitted, though wildcard expansion is not performed -
included file paths must be complete.  Config is read before \fBmetric-filter\fP changes to the
configured working directory, so non-absolute paths included are interpreted relative to the
current working directory.
.PP
\fBMetric-filter\fP has a lot of shared code with \fBministry(1)\fP and some sections are not
described here.  Refer to \fBministry.conf(5)\fP for details.

.SS [Network]
.PP
Networking configuration for \fBmetric-filter\fP greatly resembles that found in \fBministry\fP,
with the exception that \fBmetric-filter\fP filters processed metrics, and therefore does not
discriminate between stats, adder, gauge or histogram metrics.
.SS [Filter]
.PP
\fBMetric-filter\fP accepts its filter configuration as a directory of JSON files, which it watches
for changes.  The format of the files should be:
.EX
	{
		"disabled": <bool>,
		"type": "<all|allow|drop>",
		"ips": [
			"a.b.c.d",
			"e.f.g.h/i"
		],
		"matches": [
			"^this\\\\.is\\\\.a\\\\.match\\\\.",
			"!^this\\\\.is\\\\.not\\\\.",
			"^this\\\\.is\\\\."
		]
	}
.EE
.PP
The match types are:
.TP
\fBall\fR
Pass all metrics
.TP
\fBallow\fR
Allow only metrics which match the regex list
.TP
\fBdrop\fR
Allow all metrics \fBexcept\fP those matching the list
.PP
NOTE:  A leading ! inverts the sense of the regex, but does not form part of it.
.PP
These filters should be placed in a directory separate from the normal \fBmetric-filter\fP
config, and will be watched for changes.  \fBMetric-filter\fP initiates a small delay upon being
informed by \fIinotify\fP of a change to any file (or an addition), and any further changes during
this delay are folded into the reload.  This makes it easier to change a couple of files without
generating multiple reloads.  Several configuration items control the filter directory and reload
behaviour.
.TP
\fBfilters\fR
The directory to search for filter JSON files
.TP
\fBchangeDelay\fR
Number of milliseconds to wait before a reload (default 10000)
.TP
\fBdisconnect\fR
A boolean, whether hosts accepted on previous config are disconnected (default true)
.SS Metric Flush
.PP
Normal behaviour of the \fBministry\fP family of applications is asynchronous IO, with network
writes occuring to buffer before the buffers are passed for sending.  \fBMetric-filter\fP does
not write metrics to the targets immediately.  A thread for each host will watch and flush
metrics either when the output buffer is full, or upon a max-age timer.  If \fBmetric-filter\fP
is being used with data that contains timestamps, there is likely no need for an aggressive
flush, and the default of 1000msec is probably file.  If it is being used for raw data, such
as stats values, then it should be set low to prevent it interfering with the perceived flow
of data - 20ms is a good number.
.TP
\fBflushMax\fR
Milliseconds representing the max allowed age of unflushed lines (default 1000)
