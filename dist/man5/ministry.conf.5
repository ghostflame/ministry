.TH MINISTRY.CONF "5" "Nov 2015" "Networking Utilities" "Configuration Files"
.SH NAME
ministry.conf \- ministry stats daemon config file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BI /etc/ministry/ministry.conf
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual page describes the configuration file for \fBministry(1)\fP.  The file is in sections,
and including other files is permitted, though wildcard expansion is not performed - included file
paths must be complete.  Config is read before \fBministry\fP changes directory to it's configured
base directory, so non-absolute paths included are interpreted relative to the current working
directory.
.PP
The sections are used to define a context; this context is used to decide which interpreter function
examines the config line.  This means that config names are essentially namespaced to the section
in which they are found, and as such names may be present in more than one section.  Section names
are not case sensitive.  In fact, only values are case-preserving - all config variable names are
examined case-insensitively.
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP can fetch its config from an HTTP URI (http or https, though it is light on checks
for the validity of https certificates).  It will fetch the source and write it to a temporary file,
and then read it back.  At this time, \fBMinistry\fP does not support authentication for URI's.  It
uses \fIlibcurl\fP for these fetches.
.PP
By default, \fBMinistry\fP will allow URI configs to include other URI's.  This can be disabled
separately from reading a URI config.  Also by default, \fBMinistry\fP will refused to let a secure
URI config include a non-secure one, but this can be enabled explicitly.
.SH FORMAT
.SS Section Format
.PP
Sections are expected to be presented inside square brackets.  Valid sections are:  \fBmain\fP,
\fBlogging\fP, \fBnetwork\fP, \fBiplist\fP, \fBio\fP, \fBmemory\fP, \fBgc\fP, \fBsynth\fP, \fBtarget\fP
and \fBstats\fP.  e.g.
.PP
\fB[Logging]\fP
.SS Line Format
.PP
Config lines are expected to follow \fBvariable\fP = \fIvalue\fP
.PP
Whitespsace is trimmed fore and aft, and from around the = sign.  If the = and value are absent,
then the value "1" is automatically filled in.  This is useful for switching behaviour on.  Many
config variables contain dots.  Wherever lists of values are permitted, they should be
comma-separated without intervening spaces.  e.g.
.PP
\fBstats.udp.ports = 8100,8101,8102,8103\fP
.SS Booleans
.PP
Anything marked as a boolean accepts the following responses as true: (case insenstive) "true",
"y", "yes" or any non-zero number.  Any other value is taken as false.
.SS File Inclusion
.PP
Ministry can read in other config files using an \fBinclude\fP = \fIfilename\fP directive.  Extra
arguments can be passed into an \fBinclude\fP directive and those will be available inside the
included file as \fI%1%\fP, \fI%2%\fP, etc.  These can be placed within configuration values,
even embedded in strings, and they will be substituted.
.SS Foreach
.PP
Ministry can repeat a line of config with different values, using the \fBforeach\fP construct.
It is used in one of two ways, and the following line will have the value appended to it, thus it
best suits \fBinclude\fP, above.
.PP
The first way is a list of values, eg:
.PP
\fBforeach\fP = \fIfirst second third fourth fifth\fP
.PP
The second way is a numeric range, starting at the lower bound, <= the upper bound, with an
optional step value (which defaults to 1).  It understands only integers.  eg:
.PP
\fBforeach\fP = \fI1 - 100\fP
.PP
This is most commonly used in \fBministry-test\fP to easily generate a lot of different metric
configs, but could be used in \fBministry\fP for targets or port configs.
.SH CONFIG
.PP
The config variables accepted by \fBministry\fP are presented here by section.
.SS (Anywhere)
.PP
These values can appear in any section.
.TP
\fBinclude\fP
The name of another source to read in.  \fBMinistry\fP will refuse to read what it believes is the
same file twice - it could be fooled with symlinks or multiple hardlinks.  This is a protection
against circular includes.  Included source are read in depth-first, meaning reading the current
source is paused until the included file is read (possibly recursively).  This is important for any
duplication of config values, as the last one read will win.  If include is found within a section,
that section context is preserved into the new file, until it is changed by a new section heading.
.TP
\fBforeach\fP
Cycle over possible values, passing each to the next line of config.

.SS [Main]
.PP
These are a few variables controlling overall \fBministry\fP behaviour.
.TP
\fBbaseDir\fP
Directory to chdir to and which forms the basis for any relative paths.
.TP
\fBtickMsec\fP
Overall internal tick time in msec.  Controls internal time accuracy (default 20)
.TP
\fBdaemon\fP
Whether \fBministry\fP disconnects from the controlling terminal with the daemon(2) system call
(boolean, default 0).  This can also be switched on with the -d CLI option.
.TP
\fBpidFile\fP
Filename \fBministry\fP will write its process ID to (default /var/run/ministry/ministry.pid).  This
can also be overriden with the -p <file> CLI option.
.TP
\fBlimits.TYPE\fP
Make a call to setrlimit for the specified type.  Supported types are \fBprocs\fP and \fBfiles\fP.
Both default to the system hard limit of the type.

.SS [Logging]
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP can use either one, two or no logfiles (logging to stdout or syslog).  It has two blocks
of config, \fImain\fP and \fIhttp\fP.  Not specifying a block implies \fImain\fP.
.TP
\fBBLOCK.filename\fP | \fBBLOCK.file\fP | \fBBLOCK.logfile\fP
File name to write the log to.  The special value \fB-\fP writes to stdout, and is the default.  The
special value \fBsyslog\fP writes to syslog.
.TP
\fBBLOCK.level\fP
Maximum log level, one of FATAL, ERR, WARN, NOTICE, INFO or DEBUG.
.PP
The rest of the configuration items apply to all generally.
.TP
\fBunified\fP
Inform \fBministry\fP to merge the \fImain\fP and \fIhttp\fP logging (essentially, the separate \fIhttp\fP
logging block is not used).
.TP
\fBnotify\fP
Add a notification of log re-opening.  Guarantees a non-zero log file size after log rotation (boolean,
default 1).  Disabled for stdout logs and syslog.
.TP
\fBfacility\fP
Set the facility to write to syslog with (if that is the configured output).  Only some are available.
.TP
\fBidentifier\fP
Set the identifier string for syslog messages (default 'ministry').
.TP
\fBwriteLevel\fP
Set whether the log level is written in syslog lines (defaults to on).

.SS [Memory]
.TP
\fBmaxMb\fP | \fBmaxSize\fP
Maximum in-memory size (in MB) before \fBministry\fP self-terminates (default 10GB).
.TP
\fBmaxKb\fP
As above, but expressed in KB.
.TP
\fBinterval\fP
Memory size check interval, in milliseconds (default 5000)
.TP
\fBdoChecks\fP
Boolean to turn on (default) or off the memory size check.
.PP
Each memory type has a default block allocation size.  Whenever new memory is allocated
for registered types it is not done individually, but as a block, to prevent frequent calls to \fBbrk()\fP.
.PP
Valid types include: hosts, iobufs, iolist, dhash, points
.TP
\fBTYPE.block\fP
Number of instances to allocate at once.

.SS [Http]
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP has an in-built webserver, provided by \fBlibmicrohttpd\fP.  It is used for a variety
of tasks - metric submission, issuing tokens, controlling targets and offering stats and status.
\fBLibmicrohttpd\fP understands HTTPS and can manage ciphers anc certificates, so some config is
offered to control those functions.
.PP
The HTTP interface documentation can be read by fetching /.
.TP
\fBenable\fP
A boolean to control whether the HTTP server is active (default off)
.TP
\fBport\fP
The port to listen on (default 9080)
.TP
\fBbind\fP
Which IP to bind to (default 0.0.0.0)
.TP
\fBconns.max\fP
Maximum concurrent connections to the HTTP server (default 256)
.TP
\fBconns.maxPerIP\fP
Maximum concurrent connections from a single IP address (default 64)
.TP
\fBconns.timeout\fP
Seconds before a connection is considered to have died (default 10)
.TP
\fBtls.enable\fP
Boolean controlling whether we use HTTPS instead of HTTP (default off)
.TP
\fBtls.port\fP
If this option is given, and TLS is enabled, this port will be used instead of the normal one
(default 9443)
.TP
\fBtls.certFile\fP
Path to the server certificate file
.TP
\fBtls.keyFile\fP
Path to the server key file
.TP
\fBtls.keyPass\fP
Password for the server key file.  If either the \fI-K\fP option is passed to ministry on startup,
or the special value \fI-\fP is used, \fBministry\fP will prompt interactively for the password at
startup.
.TP
\fBtls.priority\fP
This string controls TLS versions, ciphers and TLS behaviour, and it passed through to the underlying
TLS library.  The default is TLS v1.2 and v1.3, only secure 256-bit ciphers, and secure renegotiation.
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP has a mechanism for validating TCP connections, involving the HTTP server.  The idea
is that valid clients connect to the HTTP server, requesting \fI/token\fP, and they receive a JSON
object containing a nonce for each of stats, adder and gauge connections.  This nonce expires in a
configurable number of milliseconds, and is only valid from the IP address that made the HTTP call.
The client must then present the token as the first line of data upon connecting, else the connection
will be closed by \fBministry\fP.
.PP
This mechanism is presented as a way to prevent scanning software or other random processing from
connecting and sending whatever data in an uncontrolled way, but is also part of planned development
to add authentication to the HTTP server, thus effectively providing authentication on metric
submission.
.TP
\fBtokens.enable\fP
A boolean controlling whether the token system is enabled (default off)
.TP
\fBtokens.filter\fP
The name of an Iplist as a filter for which hosts are required to use them
.TP
\fBtokens.lifetime\fP
A value in milliseconds for the lifetime of the token (all tokens are burned once used) (default 1000)

.SS [Pmet]
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP has an HTTP interface and can provide metrics for Prometheus, on \fB/metrics\fP.  This
is disabled whenever the HTTP server is disabled.  It is broken up in several internal sources, which
can be turned off individually.  The internal client code may at some future point be broken out into
a separate library.
.PP
Metrics generation is relatively new, and is currently off by default.  This will likely change in
future releases.
.TP
\fBenable\fP
Enable or disable the metrics endpoint (boolean, default 0).
.TP
\fBperiod\fP
Post period in milliseconds.  \fBMinistry\fP pre-generates its metrics (to properly support multiple
Prometheus servers) and will present the same page of metrics within a given period no matter how
many times it is fetched.  This controls the period of this page generation (default 10000).
.TP
\fBdisable\fP
A single source to be disabled.  This option can repeat.  Sources include: shared, targets, stats

.SS [GC]
.TP
\fBenable\fP
Whether gc is enabled or not (boolean, default 1).
.TP
\fBgcThresh\fP
How many submission cycles a path must lie empty for before it is deleted (default 8640).
.TP
\fBgcGaugeThresh\fP
How many submission cycles a gauge must not be updated for before it is deleted (default 25960).

.SS [Iplist]
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP has the concept of an ordered list of network/single ip addresses.  It uses CIDR notation.
It has the concept of match/miss entries, and a default behaviour.  So it is possible to create a list
to capture 10.0.0.0/8, but not 10.0.0.0/16, except for still capturing 10.0.0.0/24.  The lists are also
used to filter connections and apply metric prefixes.
.PP
Iplist statements finish with a \fBdone\fP statement, and may include the following:
.TP
\fBenable\fP
Turn a list on or off (boolean, default 1).
.TP
\fBdefault\fP
A boolean indicating whether the default behaviour is to match or miss (default miss).
.TP
\fBverbose\fP
A boolean indicating whether the list should be logged out once it has been read (default false).
.TP
\fBhashsize\fP
The hash size for the list.  It is rarely necessary to alter this (default 2003).
.PP
Any Iplist must also include the following:
.TP
\fBname\fP
As Iplists are created separately, then used by different config elements, they are named, and referred
to by name elsewhere.  After config read is complete, these names are matched up to ensure all lists
referred to in config actually exist.  These names must be unique.
.TP
\fBmatch\fP | \fBmiss\fP
A list element.  It expects a CIDR specification.  The /32 is optional on individual addresses.  There is no
maximum number of match/miss statements in one list.
.TP
\fBentry\fP
A list element, as used for prefixing.  It takes two arguments, the first is the CIDR range and second is the
prefix to apply to that range.
.TP
\fBdone\fP
Indicates this list is complete.  Checks are done to make sure it is valid at this point.

.SS [IO]
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP does asynchronous network IO with dedicated threads.  Each outgoing TCP connection has its own
thread to keep track of it, and buffers being sent to multiple targets are tracked separately without copying
by having a separate list of buffers to send for each target.
.TP
\fBsendMsec\fP
Interval, in msec, between checks for any buffers to send (default 11).  Reducing this too low can result in
IO threads spinning quite actively.
.TP
\fBreconnectMsec\fP
Number of msec to wait before attempting to reconnect a dead socket (default 2000).

.SS [Target]
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP shares a lot of code with \fBcarbon-copy\fP and so duplicates its behaviour for describing
network metric targets.  While \fBministry\fP sends to all enabled targets, \fBcarbon-copy\fP has rules for
which metrics to send to which targets.  So the organisation of targets makes a little more sense in the
context of \fBcarbon-copy\fP than \fBministry\fP, but for simplicity (and re-useability of target config
files) the conventions and format at the same.
.PP
The basic principle is that targets are organised into lists of equivalent targets, which will always be
given the same metrics.  This makes handling resilient multi-server targets easier.  There is no reason
a set of targets cannot be several lists of one address each, thus effectively unrelated.  However, all
targets in one list must be of the same type.
.PP
Targets have names, and lists have names.  If no list is given for a target, a new list named after that
target is created, so any reference to lists is fully optional within \fBministry\fP.  All targets must
have a type and a \fBdone\fP statement.  There is no limit to the number of targets, though each target
has a compute cost associated with it.
.TP
\fBname\fP
The name of the target, and the list if no list name is given.
.TP
\fBlist\fP
The (optional) name of the target list this target is part of.  Caution: typos will result in new lists.
\fBMinistry\fP cannot guess when you meant some other list.
.TP
\fBenable\fP
A boolean to control whether this target is used (default 1).
.TP
\fBtype\fP
What type of target this is - it affects the format of message is sent.  Recognised types include: graphite,
coal, opentsdb.
.TP
\fBport\fP
Network port to connect to the target on; if none is supplied then a default is guessed from the type.
.TP
\fBhost\fP
Address or DNS name of the target.  Lookups are made at initial connect time.  \fBMinistry\fP does not
yet support 0-second TTL DNS from the likes of consul which need looking up each time.  Default is localhost.
.TP
\fBmaxWaiting\fP
The maximum number of outstanding network buffers waiting to be sent to this target before new buffers
are dropped (default 1024).
.TP
\fBdone\fP
Signals the end of one target block.

.SS [Stats]
.TP
\fBthresholds\fP
A list of integer percentage values to generate thresholds at.  Must be 0 < x < 100.  Per-mille values are
also allowed, and are 0 < x < 1000, but must have an \fIm\fP appended, eg: \fI999m\fP.
.PP
In addition to regular thresholds and calculated values, \fBMinistry\fP can produce other sample-moment based
statistics: standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis.  It does not do this by default, and has a minimum points
check to avoid producing relatively meaningless stats about a half-dozen data points.  It also can match paths
against a whitelist/blacklist regex check - a series of expressions defining whether a path is in or out of the
list of paths receiving moments processing.
.TP
\fBmoments.enable\fP
Enable or disable moments processing (boolean, defaults to 0)
.TP
\fBmoments.minimum\fP
Set the minimum point count in stats to trigger moment calculations (default is 30)
.TP
\fBmoments.whitelist\fP, \fBmoments.blacklist\fP
A set of regular expressions to control moments calculation.  Each can appear multiple times.  The order of the
list is preserved and paths are checked against it in order, to decide if they should or should not have this
processing done.  This will have a performance impact on new path creation for stats paths, depending on the
number and nature of the expressions.
.TP
\fBmoments.fallbackMatch\fP
Set whether matching no regexes results in overall match or no match (default is to match)
.PP
A new, experiemental feature in \fBministry\fP is metric prediction.  It only applies to adder types.  It keeps
a number of value/timestamp pairs for selected metrics and runs linear regression each time a new metric is
reported.  It predicts the next period's value, compares it's previous prediction against the actual next input
and reports the modelling parameters.  This is all done by appending suffixes to the original path.
.TP
\fBpredict.enable\fP
Enable prediction processing (boolean, defaults to 0)
.TP
\fBpredict.size\fP
The number of points of data to keep for matching metrics (default 32)
.TP
\fBpredict.whitelist\fP, \fBpredict.blacklist\fP
A set of regular expressions to control metric prediction.  Each can appear multiple times.  The order of the
list is preserved and paths are checked against it in order, to decide if they should or should not have this
processing done.  This will have a performance impact on new path creation for stats paths, depending on the
number and nature of the expressions.
.TP
\fBpredict.fallbackMatch\fP
Set whether matching no regexes results in an overall match or no match (default is to \fBNOT\fP match)
.PP
The rest of these are of the form stats.XXX, adder.XXX, gauge.XXX or self.XXX, affecting the behaviour of
stats reporting, adder reporting, gauge reporting or self reporting.
.TP
\fBTYPE.threads\fP
How many reporting threads to run (not used for self) (default 2)
.TP
\fBTYPE.enable\fP
Enable or disable this reporting (boolean, defaults to 1 for all)
.TP
\fBTYPE.size\fP
Hashsize information for this type.  Not used for self.  Tells \fBministry\fP how to size the hash table
for metrics.  The number of metrics can exceed this size, but it can result in performance deteriorating.
There are five set values: \fBtiny\fP, \fBsmall\fP, \fBmedium\fP, \fBlarge\fP, and \fBxlarge\fP.  It can
also accept a number, which is taken as the hash table size.  Prime numbers are recommended here, despite
the apparent memory-friendly attraction of powers of two (that results in poor hashing behaviour, as the
hash function does limited bit-mixing).  Each type's hash size defaults to the global value.  If all three
are set, then the global value is not used anywhere.
.TP
\fBTYPE.prefix\fP
Prefix string for all metrics of this type.  (defaults:  stats.timers., (blank), stats.gauges. and
stats.ministry.)
.TP
\fBTYPE.period\fP
Reporting interval, in msec.  (default 10000 for all)
.TP
\fBTYPE.offset\fP
Reporting delay, in msec.  \fBMinistry\fP's timing loop aligns reporting intervals to the clock, so,
e.g. 10 second reporting would occur on 10-second boundaries.  The delay must be less than the period
and is used to offset reporting into that interval.  This is useful when systems report data to
\fBministry\fP on their own timing cycle but metrics may or may not make it into a given interval.
So if a reporting system submits adder data every 10 seconds, and \fBministry\fP reports every 10
seconds, it might be prudent to set an offset of 3 or 4 seconds, so that all data for the interval
is in and recorded by the interval is closed (defaults are 0 for all).

.SS [Network]
.TP
\fBtimeout\fP
Number of seconds a client connection must have been silent for before being considered dead.
.TP
\fBrcvTmout\fP
Number of seconds to set on UDP sockets for SO_RCVTIMEO (prevents receive blocking indefinitely).
.PP
Prefixing specific hosts is configured by IP address (not hostname - reverse lookups are not done).
Hostnames are looked up and first IPv4 address taken.  Networks are expected as a.b.c.d/x (where the
specified address is not the base of the network, the masking will select the network base, so
127.0.3.1/8 is the same as 127.0.0.0/8.  The argument should have a space separating the host
specifier and the prefix.  The prefix should have a trailing . but will be given one if absent.
This prefix is prepended to incoming paths at time of network read and so any later behaviour will
need to account for it.  This config key can be repeated.  \fBNote, this does not work for UDP
packets - the mechanism would be very DoS'able.\fP
.TP
\fBprefix\fP
The named prefix list to apply.
.PP
Filtering is done at TCP connect time.  A filter Iplist is created and named for use.  The assumption
is that matches are allowed, and misses rejected.  See the \fI[Iplist]\fP section for details on how
to create and order an Iplist.
.TP
\fBfilterList\fP
The named filter list to apply.
.PP
All remaining network variables are of the form stats.XXX, compat.XXX, gauge.XXX or adder.XXX, pertaining
to new-style stats ports, statsd-compatible ports, new-style gauge ports or new-style adder ports.
.TP
\fBTYPE.enable\fP
Enable or disable this type of collection (boolean, defaults to 1 for all).
.TP
\fBTYPE.tcp.backlog\fP
Backlog for incoming TCP connections (default 32).
.TP
\fBTYPE.udp.checks\fP
Perform blacklist/whitelist checks and prefixing on UDP for this type.
.PP
Everything after this is of the form TYPE.udp.XXX or TYPE.tcp.XXX, pertaining to either UDP ports
or TCP ports respectively.
.TP
\fBTYPE.PROTO.bind\fP
Bind address for this type and protocol - must be a local IP address (default IPADDR_ANY)
.TP
\fBTYPE.PROTO.enable\fP
Enable or disable his protocol for this type of collection (boolean, defaults to 1).
.TP
\fBTYPE.PROTO.port\fP
A list of listen ports, comma separated.  By default, statsd-compatible listens on 8125, the default
statsd port, new-style stats is on 9125 and new-style adder is on 9225.
.PP
\fBMinistry\fP allows several different styles of TCP handling.  It can have one thread per connection
(recommended for stats connections), or use a pool of threads (using either poll of epoll) to which
new connections are assigned, hasing on source IP/port.  This does lead to slightly uneven load.  When
a pool thread can take no more connections, future connections are rejected.  A client might then
reconnect but is likely to get a new port, and likely will hit a different thread.
.PP
So each connection type should be given a style, chosen from \fPthread\fP, \fIpool\fP (poll), or
\fIepoll\fP.  to assess how many threads to use for pooling, perform the following calculation:
.PP
\fIthreads\fP = ( \fImax-connections\fP ) / ( \fIpollMax\fB * 0.8 )
.PP
The 0.8 is to allow for uneven hashing.
.PP
This does not change the UDP listener behaviour of one thread per port.
.TP
\fBTYPE.tcp.style\fI
How to handle new connections, either with their own thread or on a thread pool.  The defaults are:
stats/compat - thread, adder/gauge - epoll.
.TP
\fBTYPE.tcp.threads\fI
How many threads in the pool for listening for each type.  Defaults are stats:60, adder:30, gauge:10,
compat:20.
.TP
\fBTYPE.tcp.pollMax\fI
Max connections to a TCP listener thread (default 128).

.SS [Synth]
.PP
Synthetic metrics are derived from submitted metrics and calculated at the point of downstream
metric generation.  The generating function has two phases, gathering and calculation.  After it
has gathered the metrics from the paths (allowing new data to accrue) it then performs synthetic
metric calculations.
.PP
Synthetics config comes in blocks, terminated by 'done' on a line on its own.  Each must have a
target path and at least one source (some operations need two), and an operation specifier.  There
may also be a static factor applied to the metric (this makes percentages easy to generator - just
set factor to 100).
.PP
There is no limit to the number of synthetics that are specified.  They do not take wildcards
(ministry has no wildcard search mechanism and it would be astonishingly expensive in large data
sets - it would have to check what matched every submission interval).
.TP
\fBtarget\fP
The metric path to create.
.TP
\fBsource\fP
A source path to take values from.
.TP
\fBoperation\fP
Operation to perform.  One of sum, diff, ratio, min, max, spread, mean, meanIf, count or active.
.TP
\fBfactor\fP
A double precision number that the synthetic metric value is multiplied by.  Default 1.
.TP
\fBdone\fP
No value - signifies the end of the synthetic block.  Error checking on source count is performed
when this config line is found.  Subsequent lines are taken to be a new synthetic block.
.SS Synthetic Operation Types
.TP
\fBsum\fP
The sum of the values of all source metrics.
.TP
\fBdiff\fP
The value of second metric is subtracted from the value of the first.
.TP
\fBratio\fP
The value of the first metric is divided by the value of the second (or zero if the second metric
value is zero).
.TP
\fBmin\fP
The lowest of all source metric values.
.TP
\fBmax\fP
The highest of all source metric values.
.TP
\fBspread\fP
The gap between the highest and lowest source metric values.
.TP
\fBmean\fP
The arithmetic mean of the values of all source metrics.
.TP
\fBmeanIf\fP
The mean of values that were presented in this period, rather than all configured.
.TP
\fBcount\fP
The number of source metrics with a non-zero value.
.TP
\fBactive\fP
Returns 0 or 1 depending on whether any data points were present.
