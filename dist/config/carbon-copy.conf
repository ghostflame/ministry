## The Ministry of Statistics, Carbon-Copy, basic config

#  The config assumes a basic format of
#  variable = value

#  Leading and trailing whitespace are trimmed, as is whitespace around the =
#  sign.  If no value is presented, a value of 1 is assumed, allowing bare
#  values to toggle on behaviour.


## Including Files

#  Further source can be read in, using the mechanism of
#  include = [?]<file path|url> <args>

#  The current section context is preserved and included files are read in
#  before continuing with the previous file.  Circular inclusion loops are
#  detected, and moaned about.

#  Arguments passed into an include can be accessed in the included file as
#  %1%, %2%, ...  Circular inclusion detection accounts for these arguments.
#  This is designed to permit the trivial creation of complex config, (though
#  mainly this is used in ministry-test) by including a single config file
#  multiple times with different arguments

#  If the target path|url begins with a ? then it is considered optional -
#  if it does not exist, or cannot be read or fetched, then a warning is
#  issued by processing continues.  Carbon-copy will stil error out if it is
#  accessible but invalid.


## Foreach

#  Carbon-copy includes an interator mechanism, which will repeat the following
#  line with each value it iterates over.  It takes two forms

#foreach <word> <word> ...

#  This form will call the next line for each of the words passed in.

#foreach <lower> - <upper> [<step>]

#  This form will count from integer lower up to and including upper, using
#  step to increment (step defaults to 1).  Eg  "10 - 20 2" would supply each
#  of 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.

#  Typical usage is in ministry-test, and the typical next line is an include,
#  but it works for ministry as well.



## Config File Sections

[Main]
#  Basedir is used to chdir to and forms the path for any relative filenames
#baseDir = /

#  Pidfile can be overridden on the command line, and the init script does do
#  that!
#pidFile = /var/run/ministry/carbon-copy.pid

#  The tick_msec value is used by an internal thread to mark time, and it
#  also helps define the responsiveness of ministry to shutdown
#tickMsec = 20

#  By default, ministry alters its nofile and nproc limits to the current
#  hard limit, but these can be set lower if desired.
#limits.procs = 4096
#limits.files = 4096

#  Normally ministry will remain connected to the initiating terminal, to
#  support such run environments as supervisord.  However, either via config
#  or a command-line option, ministry can background itself with the daemon()
#  system call, disconnecting from the terminal.
#daemon = 0


[Logging]
#  Log level is one of: debug info notice warn err fatal
#  Either notice or info is recommended
#level = info

#  Logging is buffered up until the file is opened successfully.  If you are
#  Using logrotate, a pkill -HUP ministry will cause the file to be closed
#  and reopened.

#  Carbon-copy can log to syslog, and the special filename 'syslog' will cause
#  this behaviour.  By default, however, carbon-copy logs to stdout, to make
#  it easier to use in containers
#file = -

#  When the log file is reopened after log rotation (a HUP signal causes the
#  file handle to be closed and opened) the logger writes a line to say that
#  the log file was re-opened.  This means it will always be a non-zero file
#  size, meaning logrotate notifempty will not trigger.  This is turned on by
#  default, so set to zero if you wish to disable this line.
#notify = 1

#  Some syslog setups print the syslog level; some do not.  So the writing of
#  the log level in the message can be controlled.  It is on by default.
#writeLevel = 1

#  When using syslog, Carbon-copy defaults to LOG_LOCAL4 facility and identifier
#  'carbon-copy'.  These can be set (though have no effect unless syslog output
#  is selected.
#facility = LOG_LOCAL4
#identifier = carbon-copy


[Memory]
#  This is the direct control of the memory management code within carbon-copy.
#  Carbon-copy eschews a lot of malloc and free in favour of keeping structures
#  and re-using them.  This gives us some tuning parameters and avoids long-
#  term fragmentation issues.

#  Carbon-copy keeps an eye on its overall RSS, and will exit if it uses too
#  Much.  It keeps buffers when a given target is unavailable, and these can
#  back up significantly.  The default is 1GB
#maxMB = 1024

#  The maxMb value is also expressible as max KB if you want more precise
#  control.  Don't use both - last one wins
#maxKB = 1048576

#  The interval of memory checking is configurable as well - this is how
#  many MSEC ministry waits in betweeen RSS checks
#interval = 5000

#  The memory checking routine can be disabled, but is on by default
#doChecks = 1

#  Carbon-copy can pre-allocate busy memmory types to try and avoid the rather
#  expensive brk() call to allocate more space for them happening within a
#  receive/process cycle.  It looks for the free count of a type of object
#  falling below about a third of its allocation block size and pre-emptively
#  allocates some more.  If your installation is subject to very rapid onset
#  of load, like in-rush load tests of the monitored estate, this can be
#  tuned lower.  Value is in MSEC.
#prealloc = 50



#  Each of carbon-copy's memory-controlled types is pre-allocated in blocks
#  which are made into the 'free list' of structs of that type.  They all
#  have ->next elements first, and that's how it works.  So each can be
#  pre-allocated in configurable blocks.  Powers of two please.  Future
#  releases might force this by changing it to require the power of two to
#  use, not the resulting number (eg 128 might become 7)

#  Iobufs are used for sending data on to targets, and receiving from hosts
#iobufs.block = 128

#  Iobps (IO buf pointers) is used to manage sending one buf to multiple
#  targets
#iobps.block = 512

#  Htreqs are http request objects
#htreqs.block = 128

#  Host structures are for controlling a connected source of data
#hosts.block = 128

#  Hbufs are used for buffering data bound for different targets
#hbufs.block = 128


[Http]
#  Carbon-copy uses libmicrohttpd to embed a webserver.  It uses it for a
#  variety of tasks - issuing tokens, controlling targets realtime, offering
#  stats and status.

#  Libmicrohttpd understands HTTPS and can manage ciphers and certificates,
#  so a little config is provided to govern that.  Certificates provide one
#  of the few breaks to carbon-copy's lights-out philosophy, in that if a
#  cert requires a password and you do not wish to store it anywhere in
#  config, carbon-copy can interactively prompt the user on the command-line
#  for the password.

#  Which port carbon-copy listens on is specified for http and https, and
#  which is in use is determined by whether https is enabled.
#port = 9080

#  Carbon-copy can bind either to a specific IP address or to all interfaces
#bind = 0.0.0.0

#  The entire webserver can be enabled or disabled.  It is off by default.
#enable = 0

#  Carbon-copy can expose a /stats interface that gives a number of details
#  about memory usage, uptime, etc.
#stats = 1


#  Carbon-copy exposes libmicrohttpd's controls on maximum connections per
#  IP, maximum overall and connection timeouts.
#conns.max = 256
#conns.maxPerIP = 64

#  The timeout is in seconds
#conns.timeout = 10


#  Control of TLS is around certificates and ciphers.  Carbon-copy uses the
#  facilities of libmicrohttpd to handle this.

#  Determines whether TLS is enabled
#tls.enable = 0

#  The TLS port is not the same as the non-TLS port normally, but there is
#  no problem setting them to be the same.  Whether TLS is enabled or not
#  determines which port carbon-copy uses.
#tls.port = 9443

#  Certificate and key files are relative to the basedir unless they begin
#  with a /
#tls.certFile =
#tls.keyFile =

#  If a password is needed for the keyfile, it should be provided in config
#  or interactively on startup (carbon-copy can prompt for it if required -
#  this is set either by passing the -K flag, or configuring the password
#  as the special value "-".  The special value "null" will keep the
#  password unset (it is provided as a reminder for the admin that there is
#  no password set on the key).
#tls.keyPass =


#  Carbon-copy sets a TLS priorities string (see
#  https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html).  This allows
#  control of ciphers and protocols for TLS.  The default enabled TLSv1.3,
#  TLSv1.2, and only 256-bit ciphers from certain suites.  Change this if
#  you need to support clients with older TLS libraries.  At some point in
#  the future, carbon-copy will remove support for TLSv1.2.
#tls.priority = "SECURE256:!VERS-TLS1.1:!VERS-TLS1.0:!VERS-SSL3.0:%SAFE_RENEGOTIATION"



[Iplist]
#  Carbon-copy has the concept of IP lists - a list of whitelist/blacklist
#  entries used to decide if an IP address matches for a given purpose.
#  Rather than have them at the site of the calling config - for example,
#  prefixing, or accept filtering, Carbon-copy has named IP lists, which are
#  then referenced by these calling configs.  There is no limit to the
#  number of them.

#  Lists need a unique name, a hashsize (individual IPs are hashed, but
#  networks done with masking).  They can be logged out during startup if
#  marked as verbose.  They can default to match or miss.  They can be
#  individually enabled/disabled.

#  IP lists can take a parameter after the IP spec, which is recorded as
#  text.  This is the way they are used for prefixing, where the text
#  after a given entry is used as the prefix.  The other use case is for
#  filtering connections; any text after the spec will be ignored.

#  Each IP list is configured with a set of entries, terminating in a
#  'done' statement.  Ordering of list entries is preserved, and they are
#  checked in that order.  So, if there are three entries:

#  match:  10.0.1.0/24
#  miss:   10.0.0.0/22
#  match:  10.0.0.0/16

#  Then 10.0.1.2 will match, 10.0.0.2 will not, but 10.0.20.2 will.

#  An example filter list looks like this:
#name = Approved Hosts
#enable = 1
#default = 0
#verbose = 0
#hashsize = 2003
#match = 10.32.0.0/23
#match = 10.32.2.0/23
#match = 10.32.7.161
#match = 10.32.7.162
#match = 10.32.7.163
#miss = 10.32.0.0/18
#match = 10.32.0.0/16
#done

#  IP Lists are also used for prefixing.

#  Arguments are of the form of "<specifier> <prefix>." with a trailing dot.
#  Prefix sanitisation is limited to making sure there is a trailing dot.
#  A different line parser function is invoked if a host matches for prefix
#  prepending, which copies the string into a buffer before working on it.
#  This places different limits on the size of paths allowed, and at present
#  it is hardcoded to prefix + path maxing out at 8191 bytes.  Prefixes
#  themselves are capped at 1023 bytes.  Excess whitespace before the prefix
#  is ignored, allowing lined-up formatting

#  An example prefixing list looks like this:
#name = Prefixes
#enable = 1
#default = 0
#hashsize = 2003
#entry = 10.32.0.9       hosts.pentesting.
#entry = 10.32.1.0/24    net.dmz.
#entry = 10.23.2.0/28
#entry = 10.32.2.0/23    net.protected.
#done

#  The entry with no prefix will simply have no prefix



[Io]
#  Carbon-copy's network IO is asynchronous with threads that write to network,
#  to prevent blocking during time-sensitive operations.  It also has the
#  virtue that sending the same content to multiple targets becomes easy, as
#  buffers are written and then attached to IO threads to writing.  Multiple
#  targets are indepdendently tracked, with IO buffering handled separately,
#  so one unresponsive target will not prevent working ones from receiving
#  data.

#  This means that separate threads are created for each target, and they
#  will look for data to send on an interval.  This is controllable in
#  either USEC or MSEC.
#sendUsec = 11000
#  or
#sendMsec = 11

#  Carbon-copy will pause before attempting to reconnect to a dead target, as
#  the most likely cause is either a process restart or host restart, and
#  those may not be instant.
#reconnectMsec = 2000



[Target]
#  Carbon-copy understands a couple of different types of target, though the
#  primary type is graphite-compatible types.  Support for OpenTSDB is
#  limited.  Targets are defined as a network target, a type, and how many
#  IO buffers to hold for sending.

#  Targets are also organised into lists.  Data is not sent to single
#  targets but rather to lists.  When a list is targeted by a regex-based
#  relay rule, every member of the list gets the same data.  When a list
#  is the target of a hash-based relay rule, targets from the list are
#  chosen by hashing.

#  Where no list value is given, it defaults to the name, making a list of 1.

#  An example target.
#name = local
#host = 10.32.6.10
#port = 2003
#type = graphite
#enable = 1
#maxWaiting = 1024
#done




[Network]
#  Network timeout sets how long a source connection has to be silent for
#  before we consider it dead and close the connection.  Don't set this too
#  low or clients will keep having to reconnect.
#  This value is in SECONDS
#timeout = 3600

#  Carbon-copy listens for UDP packets if configured to do so, but by default
#  recv() just waits forever.  Thus we set a receive timeout value and loop
#  around in quiet times.  This value affects how responsive ministry is to
#  shutdown.  You shouldn't need to change it.  It is in SECONDS.
#rcvTmout = 3


#  Carbon-copy flushes received metrics on a cycle.  By the time carbon-copy
#  receives them, they should already have timestamps so faithful adherence
#  to submission windows is presumed not to be necessary.  However, if
#  carbon-copy is used to route pre-timestamp metrics, the flush timing can
#  be set low to reduce interference from this mechanism.
#flushMsec = 2000


#  Carbon-copy can prepend fixed strings to paths received from hosts that
#  connect with TCP and are specified in config.  The strings are prepended
#  at network receive time, so later functions like synthetics will perceive
#  the updated path, not the original path.  This is done by creating a
#  prefix-style IP List and then selecting it for use here.
#prefix = <name>


#  Carbon-copy can also enforced IP Lists for connecting clients.  An IP list
#  is created and then referenced within network config
#filterList = <name>



#  Carbon-copy can use either TCP or UDP to receive metrics; all it asks of
#  the format is that the first string present in the line (delimited by
#  space or colon) is suitable for hashing.

#  Carbon-copy operates a thread per connected source, and separate thread
#  bound to the listening port.

#  UDP ports do not permit the same behaviour, so a single thread listens on
#  each UDP port.  To permit multiple threads to handle UDP traffic, multiple
#  ports must be specified, and the clients should load-balance themselves
#  across this.  Alternative, on Linux, Iptables may be capable of helping.
#  There is no requirement to make one client sticky to one point.

#  By default, IP whitelist/blacklist checks and path prefixing are not
#  done on UDP data as they impact performance.  This can be lit up, type
#  by type, with a specific checks options.


#  The rest of the configuration is applied either to TCP or UDP, with the
#  protocol as the first element of the config line.


#  Enable/disable a given protocol
#tcp.enable = 1
#udp.enable = 1

#  do checks with ip whitelist/blacklists and do prefixing (TCP only)
#tcp.checks = 0
#udp.checks = 0

#  Ports - a comma-separated list of UDP listen ports; it makes no sense
#  to have multiple TCP ports.
#tcp.port  = 3901
#udp.port  = 3901


#  bind address - which IP address to bind to.  Defaults to all.
#tcp.bind  = 0.0.0.0
#udp.bind  = 0.0.0.0

#  TCP backlog - how many outstanding connections to queue up
#  This is limited by the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn
#tcp.backlog  = 32



[Relay]
#  Carbon-copy takes blocks of config controlling how it relays
#  metrics between targets.  It can both match on regexes and use
#  well-known hashing algorithms to choose a target or targets for an
#  incoming data line.

#  Relay config blocks use *either* regex or hash, but a block can be
#  marked as 'last' to prevent further matching.

#  Carbon-relay interprets a regular expression that begins with an
#  exclamation mark (!) as a negative match.  The maximum number of
#  regexes in a single block is 32.

#  Valid hash functions are:  cksum, fnv1, fnv1a (used by carbon
#  relay)

#  Two sample blocks are provided
#name = regex-block
#regex = ^match_something_first
#regex = !^but_not_this
#regex = !and_not_ending_with_this$
#target = my_graphite_target
#continue
#done

#name = hash-block
#hash = fnv1a
#target = other_graphite_list
#last
#done
