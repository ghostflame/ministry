.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBCarbon-copy\fP is a network daemon which can route and copy graphite-like metrics to named
targets with options for hashing and duplication.
.PP
The main options are:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
print help
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
print version and exit
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
just test config and exit
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fI<FILE|URI>\fR
select config source instead of default file
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
be strict about parsing config
.TP
\fB\-F\fR
disable reading config source (environment only)
.TP
\fB\-E\fR
disable reading variables from the environment
.TP
\fB\-U\fR
disable reading any URI config (even if given with -c)
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
disable URI config including other URI configs
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
allow insecure URI's
.TP
\fB\-I\fR
allow secure URI's to include insecure URI's
.TP
\fB\-D\fR
run in debug mode
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
run in verbose mode, with more output to stdout
.PP
The config file format is in sections, denoted as \fB[Section]\fR and is of a general format of:
.TP
\fBvariable\fR = \fIvalue\fR
.PP
It may use the keyword \fBinclude\fR to read in another file - the current section context is kept.
.PP
The default config file is /etc/carbon-copy/carbon-copy.conf
.SH Behaviour
.PP
\fBCarbon-copy\fP listens on a network port for graphite/coal metrics.  It assesses each line
against configured rules, and forwards the metrics according to those rules to none, one or more
targets.  It does not transform metrics in any way, nor aggregate them.  It is a drop-in replacement
for the likes of \fBcarbon-relay\fP or \fBcarbon-c-relay\fP.
