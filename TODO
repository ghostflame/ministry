Stats generation
	Allow for usec timestamps - multiple buffers

Monitoring
	carbon-copy self-metrics
		difficult - lines accumulate on connected hosts,
		not on a structure about the target.  Need to move
		the stats onto some per-target structure.

Operational Readiness

	Pen Testing
    review:  https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/658.html
		done:	https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/14.html

Carbon-Copy
    Crashing with multiple sources (from ministry test)
		Can no longer reproduce

Clustering
	Maintain a cluster geometry and hash on the first 20 chars
	to determine which handles a metric?  Or maintain 'fake'
	DHASHs that just point to another cluster member.  Forwarding
	needs to be very low latency
	Do we need a 'pickled' handler that understands the hashing?
	Cannot guarantee the same hash sizes, so we need to send
	just the hash value.  A struct?
	:len:type:hv:dblval:string:   Or port per type?

Consul registration?
	https://www.consul.io/api/agent/service.html#register-service

Slack integration?
	Send warns/errors to slack?
	Or specific slack messages
	Slack thread, with messaging memhl
	How to avoid fail-loop?
		generate err
		fail to send
			generates err
				fails to send...

Prometheus metrics
	If we get slack working, notify about:
		Not scraped in 24 hrs?    (needs a config option to shut up)
			So keep track of scraping
		Target not working for 24 hrs?
