Refactor
    Consider how to reduce the amount of calls to poll()
        It returns as soon as any fd is ready
        So with multiple fd's active it is hitting one and returning
            then we have to poll again to catch the next one
        How can we have a small interval then check them all?
    Looks like prealloc isn't working.
