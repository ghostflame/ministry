Refactor
    Looks like prealloc isn't working.
	
HTTP
	Accept submissions via HTTP - leaking memory.  It's not the post size that matters
		Well:
			29.33K per large post
			17.61K per short post
	Prometheus metrics (requires significant memory)

Network
	More granular token control
		Allow a token / non-token port on one type
        Force some IPs to present a token?

Data types
	none

Stats generation
	Allow for usec timestamps - multiple buffers

Monitoring
	carbon-copy self-metrics

Operational Readiness
	Pen Testing
